# 📚 Python Project - Exceptions 🚨

Welcome to this project dedicated to learning how to handle exceptions in Python!  
Here, you'll discover how to make your code more robust and avoid unexpected crashes. 😎

---

## ✨ Objectives

- Understand the difference between errors and exceptions
- Learn how to catch, raise, and handle exceptions in Python
- Make your programs more reliable

---

## 🛠️ Project Functions

### 1️⃣ Safe List Printing
Prints the first `x` elements of a list, even if some cause problems.

### 2️⃣ Safe Integer Printing
Prints an integer if possible, otherwise handles the error gracefully.

### 3️⃣ Print and Count Integers
Prints and counts only the integers among the first `x` elements of a list.

### 4️⃣ Integer Division with Error Handling
Divides two integers and prints the result, even if an error occurs.

### 5️⃣ Element-wise Division of Two Lists
Creates a new list with the result of each division, handling all possible errors.

### 6️⃣ Raise a TypeError Exception
Function that deliberately raises a `TypeError` exception.

### 7️⃣ Raise a NameError with a Message
Function that raises a `NameError` with a custom message.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:  
   `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Navigate to the folder:  
   `cd python-exceptions`
3. Run the Python scripts to test each feature:  
   `./0-safe_print_list.py`  
   `./1-safe_print_integer.py`  
   etc.

## 🧠 Tips

- Always use `try` / `except` blocks to keep your program from crashing!
- Read error messages carefully—they help you understand what went wrong.
- Don’t hesitate to comment your code for clarity.
